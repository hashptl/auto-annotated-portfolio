  as part of my application assignments this year, I atomised a MIT technology
  review article on a brain map created by google "a peta-voxel fragment of the
  human cerebral cortex reconstructed at a subcellular resolution". The only
  purpose of this semantic dissection is to understand what makes a piece of
  science communication, worth reading.

[The reviewed article is linked here](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/05/09/1092223/google-map-cubic-millimeter-human-brain/)

At first glance, the title "Google helped make an exquisitely detailed map of a tiny piece of the human brain" gives away that the coverage has to do with neuroscience or connectomics. Since MIT Technology Review is the bleeding edge of science stories, often publishing a cohesive journalistic piece on the subject of focus on the very same day that the original research is published on the primary academic sources like Science and Nature. The former is for seasoned personnel, but at Tech Review, it’s broken to the general public with urgency and a neutral stance.

The mention of "Google" at the very beginning is a clear signal that the implications of the story may be huge, given its relation to the global tech behemoth owned by Alphabet, albeit a clever way to generate engagement from scientific audiences and laypeople alike. While this may also be interpreted as tilting toward a particular private corporation, so far this is strong journalism for digital dissemination.

Moving from the meta-title and cutting right to the chase, the story articulates how the peta-voxel fragment of the human cerebral cortex reconstructed at a subcellular resolution, is different from pre-existing repositories of advanced brain atlases. This is the locus of why the story is important in the first place, prospectively an essential tool for those already in the field while inviting neighbouring research cohorts. The piece cites primary sources for clarity of reference and verification, as reputable scientific press must.

Usage of superlatives in the draft is justified because the technology itself is monumental “the most detailed map of the human brain ever created.” Author has given a positive angle to the story. Tonality is not argumentative or opinionated like a guest essay. No active attempt to persuade the reader toward a certain conclusion like an Op-ed column in Nautilus or Undark Magazine, wherein the information is analyzed and outfitted with critique. Ethics in journalism is important; evidently, the draft does not mention the details of the epileptic patient from whom the neural specimen was extracted.

Syntactically, the piece loosely adheres to the IMRAD (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) framework. Elucidating the scale and importance of the subject matter, how computation-intensive it was. Methods are broken down for ease of understanding  “cutting the tissue into 5,000 slices” explaining ML-integrated imaging techniques and electron microscopy. Descriptions of the map's “1,400 neurons and 700,000 synapses” vividly illustrate the development and results thereby helping it fit into the “Biotechnology & Health” column where it is rightly categorized.

Scientific lexicon is integrated into the draft without any confounding jargon. Accurate biological terminologies like “synapses” and “neurons” are succeeded with brief explanations. This is good for comprehension; perhaps the most important aim of science communication is to atomize complex technical knowledge in a way that adds to the learning curves of diverse, non-expert audiences, and I believe this piece achieves that substantially.

A hallmark of credible scientific articles is the inclusion of viewpoints from varying experts across disciplines. Those who were not directly involved will have a different vantage point for viewing the said brain map; demonstrated through quotes by Michael Hawrylycz, who was an outsider to the study, and Jeff Lichtman, who led the Harvard and Google team for the project, a remarkable data-gathering effort on the author’s part, making the narrative rich and balanced.

Limitations of the research are clearly outlined. The acknowledgment that the sample represents just a “cubic millimeter” of brain tissue from an individual patient with a singular diagnosis of brain disorder - signals an understanding of the work's scope as fairly limited and therefore in need of further avenues of R\&D. This elicits sound scientific reporting done with integrity, instead of just sensationalizing the good bits of the story.

Finally, in praise of the article, the draft includes a comprehensive explanation of relevant visual aid for the colored excitatory neurons in the beginning, which links seamlessly to the ending with an unambiguous call-to-action for visiting [Neuroglancer](https://h01-release.storage.googleapis.com/landing.html), wherein the open-source digital brain map is present for viewing, this is an element that broadens the scope for interaction, delivers good closure to the audience, and triggers open scientific discussions.
