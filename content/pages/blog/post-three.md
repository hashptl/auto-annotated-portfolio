<div style="text-align: left">Case study : “404 is open-source. We belong to no one, and we belong to everyone.”Strange how it’s always the art school kids who are among the first groups of humans to experiment with tech—big science and vice-versa, like the understanding of why Steve Jobs obsessed over a typeface and the design of the iconic Mac trash can and why so many of us believed that teaching a machine to make art would be the best idea, so it can acclimate to our biological, cognitive mannerisms. This led me to discover and appreciate 404, a barely mainstream brand with its enigmatic body of work.The highly immersive branding concept and design suite for 404, the NL-based platform to construct decentralized incentive-based networks via Bittensor, is created by Antinomy Studios in collaboration with multiple artists. The concept has to do with the Voyager 1 probe sent from Earth, containing the golden record as a greeting from our planet to intelligent life in outer space. It is now the only man-made object to have traveled 14 billion miles from the sun.![](/images/1721227700397.jpg)404, if I were to give an oversimplified breakdown, dabbles with the whole intent of democratizing intelligence networks to build (very) interactive (and dare I say, inventively gorgeous) meta-worlds, simply by describing them. It’s ambitious and founded on the vision for Web3 (the open and decentralized future of the internet built on blockchain technology). It gives you the chance to feel that something as digital and ephemeral as information and graphics are mutable like the physical world and can be molded like clay, much like thoughts can be.![](/images/voyager-record-diagram.webp)A research question that 404 asked during the process of launching their brand concept was, “Is creative technology worth it?” And as far as the worth of anything goes, ideas are the only technology that surpass the likes of both machines and of men. They are carried through time and across immeasurable scales, like the golden record itself.</div>
